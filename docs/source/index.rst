   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to traDSSAT!
====================
TraDSSAT aims to reinvent the wheel, once and for all, for `DSSAT <https://www.dssat.net>`_ file management. Whether
for preparing input files for automated DSSAT runs or for analysing outputs, traDSSAT's simple Python interface and
modular structure will (we hope!) dramatically simplify your code.
